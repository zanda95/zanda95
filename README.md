### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



Iâ€™m Zana Darwish, also known as zanda95 on GitHub. Iâ€™m passionate about using technology to solve problems and make a positive impact. I have several repositories on my GitHub profile, including projects related to analyzing emergent competencies/job roles, a Trivia Quest game, electricity prices and Rainfall Prediction machine learning project. Iâ€™m always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
